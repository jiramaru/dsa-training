# Practice DSA and upgrade your coding skills by solving these problems!
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, practicing these problems will improve your problem-solving abilities and prepare you for technical interviews.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiramaru/algo_training.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd algo_training
```
You can then explore the various problem categories and start solving them using your preferred programming language.

## Create a Branch for Your Solutions
To keep your contributions organized, create a new branch for your solutions. Use the following command, replacing `your_name` with your actual name:
```bash
git checkout -b your_name
```

## Create a sub-directory for your solutions
To keep your solutions organized, create a sub-directory named after your GitHub username inside the relevant problem category folder. For example:
```bash
mkdir -p exercises/exercice_1/solutions/your_name/{js,python,c}
```
replacing `your_name` with your actual name.
Create files for each problem you solve in the appropriate language sub-directory (e.g., `js`, `python`, `c`). For example:
```bash
touch exercices/exercice_1/solutions/your_name/js/{problem_1.js,problem_2.js,problem_3.js}
touch exercices/exercice_1/solutions/your_name/python/{problem_1.py,problem_2.py,problem_3.py}
touch exercices/exercice_1/solutions/your_name/c/{problem_1.c,problem_2.c,problem_3.c}
```

You can then add your solution files inside this directory.

## Pushing Your Changes
After adding your solutions, you can push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add solutions for exercise_1 by your_name"
git push origin your_name
```
