# Practice DSA and upgrade your coding skills by solving these problems!
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, practicing these problems will improve your problem-solving abilities and prepare you for technical interviews.

## Getting Started
To get started, fork this repository on GitHub, then clone your fork to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/dsa-training.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd dsa-training
```
You can then explore the various problem categories and start solving them using your preferred programming language.

## Create a Branch for Your Solutions
To keep your contributions organized, create a new branch for your solutions. Use the following command, replacing `your_name` with your actual name (e.g., `deo-bata`):
```bash
git checkout -b your_name
# Example: git checkout -b deo-bata
```

## Create a sub-directory for your solutions
To keep your solutions organized, create a sub-directory named after your GitHub username inside the `solutions/` folder. For each problem you solve, create a structure by problem and language. For example:
```bash
mkdir -p solutions/your_name/p-01-conditions/{python,js,c}
mkdir -p solutions/your_name/p-02-arrays/{python,cpp}
mkdir -p solutions/your_name/p-03-strings/{python,js}
```
For example, if your GitHub username is `deo-bata`:
```bash
mkdir -p solutions/deo-bata/p-01-conditions/{python,js,c}
mkdir -p solutions/deo-bata/p-02-arrays/{python,cpp}
mkdir -p solutions/deo-bata/p-03-strings/{python,js}
```

Create files for each problem you solve in the appropriate language sub-directory (e.g., `python/`, `js/`, `c/`, `cpp/`). For example:
```bash
touch solutions/deo-bata/p-01-conditions/python/solution-01.py
touch solutions/deo-bata/p-01-conditions/js/solution-01.js
touch solutions/deo-bata/p-02-arrays/python/solution-02.py
touch solutions/deo-bata/p-03-strings/python/solution-03.py
```

You can then add your solution files inside this directory.

## Pushing Your Changes
After adding your solutions, commit and push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add solutions for p-01-conditions by your_name"
git push origin your_name
# Example: git push origin deo-bata
```
